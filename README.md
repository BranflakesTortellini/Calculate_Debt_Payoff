# Debt Payoff Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates the debt payoff schedule based on the initial balance, APR (annual percentage rate), base minimum payment rate, and payment multiples provided by the user. It utilizes tkinter for a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for user input and Pandas for data manipulation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Tkinter
  
## Installation
You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```


## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input the initial balance, APR, base minimum payment rate, and minimum payment multiples when prompted.
3. The script will generate a debt payoff schedule and prompt you to save the results as an Excel file.

## Notes
- The script includes a failsafe to prevent infinite looping.
- Ensure payment multiples are entered separated by commas (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2).
